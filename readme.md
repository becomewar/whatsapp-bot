```

```bash
cd whatsapp-bot
```

```bash
yarn install
```

## Environment variables

```env
MAINTENANCE_MODE=false
BASE_URL_=http://localhost:3200
```

- **MAINTENANCE_MODE:** Indicates if the bot is under maintenance, if true, it will respond with its current status and will not perform any function.
- **BASE_URL:** If not entered, it will be by default: `http://localhost:3004`

## Server

> _BASE_URL_ Configuration for group authorizations to work:

We need a file to store all the information:

```bash
touch ~/src/Server/db.json
```

Now open this file in your text editor and paste the object below:

```json
{
  "authorizations": []
}
```

### Development environment

We are using the package [json-server](https://yarnpkg.com/package/json-server) to create a fake RestApi, where we will save our database. To start it, enter the Server folder and issue the following commands:

```
cd src/Server
```

```
yarn install
```

If you are in the development environment, just run `yarn start`.

## Execution

```
yarn start
```
